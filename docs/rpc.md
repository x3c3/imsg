description: "Long-running JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio for chats, history, watch, and send — same surfaces as the CLI, one process."
---

`imsg rpc` exposes the read and send surfaces over JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout. It's designed for agents and gateways that want a single long-lived process for chats, history, send, and watch — without a TCP port, daemon, or system service.

## Transport

- One JSON object per line on stdin (request) and stdout (response/notification).
- JSON-RPC 2.0 framing: `jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`, `params`.
- Notifications omit `id`.
- Stderr is reserved for human-readable diagnostics.
- Startup failures such as missing Full Disk Access are returned as JSON-RPC
  errors on the first request instead of human-readable stdout banners.

## Lifecycle

- The host process spawns one `imsg rpc` child.
- The child stays alive across many requests and one-or-more watch subscriptions.
- No TCP port. No launch agent. No `imsg` daemon to install.

The pattern intentionally mirrors language servers and the way `imsg`'s parent gateway (Clawdis) supervises subprocesses — a single signal-style child that exits cleanly when stdin closes.

## Methods

### `chats.list`

Params:

- `limit` (int, default 20)

Result:

```json
{ "chats": [Chat] }
```

### `messages.history`

Params:

- `chat_id` (int, required) — preferred identifier.
- `limit` (int, default 50)
- `participants` (array of handle strings, optional)
- `start` / `end` (ISO 8601, optional)
- `attachments` (bool, default `false`)

Result:

```json
{ "messages": [Message] }
```

### `watch.subscribe`

Params:

- `chat_id` (int, optional) — omit for all-chat stream.
- `since_rowid` (int, optional) — exclusive cursor.
- `participants` (array, optional)
- `start` / `end` (ISO 8601, optional)
- `attachments` (bool, default `false`)
- `include_reactions` (bool, default `false`)
- `debounce_ms` (int, default `500`)

Result:

```json
{ "subscription": 1 }
```

Notifications (one per emitted message):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "message",
  "params": {
    "subscription": 1,
    "message": { ... }
  }
}
```

The RPC default debounce (`500ms`) is intentionally higher than the CLI default (`250ms`). RPC's typical caller is an agent that just sent a message and is waiting for the inbound echo to settle (`is_from_me` correction, attachment metadata, …). 500ms is enough for those follow-ups to land before the message is emitted.

Like the CLI watch, RPC watch backs filesystem events with a low-frequency poll so a missed event or a rotated SQLite sidecar doesn't leave the subscription silent.

### `watch.unsubscribe`

Params:

- `subscription` (int, required)

Result:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

### `send`

Params (direct send):

- `to` (string, required)
- `text` (string, optional)
- `file` (string, optional)
- `service` (`imessage` | `sms` | `auto`, optional)
- `region` (string, optional)

Params (chat target):

- `chat_id` *or* `chat_identifier` *or* `chat_guid` — exactly one. `chat_id` is preferred.
- `text` / `file` as above.

Result:

```json
{ "ok": true, "id": 1979, "guid": "8DF..." }
```

`id` and `guid` are best-effort. `send` returns them when the inserted row can be observed in `chat.db` after Messages accepts the send. Attachment-only sends, delayed database writes, or ambiguous direct sends may return only `{"ok": true}`.

For chat-target sends, `send` also performs the [Tahoe ghost-row check](send.md#tahoe-ghost-row-protection): if Messages writes an empty unjoined SMS row instead of delivering, the call returns an error rather than `{"ok": true}`.

## Objects

### Chat

See [JSON output → Chat](json.md#chat). Every field documented there appears in the RPC `chats.list` response.

### Message

See [JSON output → Message](json.md#message). When `include_reactions: true`, message notifications also include the reaction extension fields (`is_reaction`, `reaction_type`, `reaction_emoji`, `is_reaction_add`, `reacted_to_guid`).

`account_id`, `account_login`, `last_addressed_handle`, and outgoing `destination_caller_id` are read-only routing diagnostics; the AppleScript send API does not expose a `from` selector.

## Examples

Request `chats.list`:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"chats.list","params":{"limit":10}}
```

Response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","result":{"chats":[...]}}
```

Subscribe to a chat:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"2","method":"watch.subscribe","params":{"chat_id":1}}
```

Notification on each new message:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"message","params":{"subscription":2,"message":{...}}}
```

Send and receive verification:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"3","method":"send","params":{"to":"+14155551212","text":"hi"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"3","result":{"ok":true,"transport":"applescript","id":1979,"guid":"8DF..."}}
```

`send` accepts `transport: "auto" | "bridge" | "applescript"`. `auto`
uses the IMCore bridge for existing chats when it is running, then falls back
to AppleScript. Use `bridge` when the caller requires private-API delivery and
should fail instead of falling back.
