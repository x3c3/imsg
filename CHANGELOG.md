# Changelog

## 0.8.3 - Unreleased

### Private API Bridge
- fix: support threaded attachment replies via `send-rich --file` and
  `send-attachment --reply-to`, including the macOS 26 attachment staging
  fallback (#113, #114, thanks @omarshahine).

## 0.8.2 - 2026-05-11

### JSON-RPC
- fix: keep `imsg rpc` stdout strictly JSONL when startup fails before the
  database opens; Full Disk Access failures now answer the caller's request
  with a JSON-RPC error instead of printing the human permission banner to
  stdout.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-05-09

### Release Packaging
- fix: include the IMCore bridge helper dylib in macOS release archives and
  search Homebrew install paths for brew-installed advanced features (#111,
  thanks @omarshahine).

### Messaging
- fix: route JSON-RPC `send` through the IMCore bridge when it is available,
  with automatic AppleScript fallback and an explicit `transport` override
  (#108).
- fix: resolve JSON-RPC `typing` direct recipients against existing chat GUIDs
  before synthesizing an `iMessage`/`SMS` prefix (#109).
- fix: stage bridge attachments before dylib sends and let
  `send-attachment --transport auto` fall back to AppleScript for normal files
  when the bridge is unavailable (#110, thanks @omarshahine).

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-08

### Linux Read-Only Preview
- feat: add a Linux read-only core build with fixture-backed tests and GitHub
  CI coverage for copied Messages databases.
- build: add Linux release archive packaging for `imsg-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`.
- docs: document Linux as read-only support for existing copied Messages
  databases.

### Message Decoding
- fix: strip printable typedstream length bytes from recovered `attributedBody`
  text for 32-126 byte messages (#107, thanks @SagarSDagdu).

## 0.7.3 - 2026-05-06

### Private API Bridge
- fix: restore macOS 26 bridge sends, replies, tapbacks, typing/read RPC, and
  chat/group lifecycle RPC methods after the BlueBubbles-inspired bridge port
  regressed on Tahoe (#101, thanks @omarshahine).
- fix: stage bridge attachments with the target chat GUID and fall back to the
  modern IMDPersistence save API when the legacy persistent-path API returns
  nil (#102, #103, thanks @omarshahine).

### Security
- fix: harden bridge IPC queue directories and attachment paths against
  symlink traversal while preserving trusted macOS system aliases like `/tmp`
  (#105, thanks @omarshahine).

## 0.7.2 - 2026-05-06

### Release Packaging
- fix: publish a fresh signed and notarized macOS patch archive with matching
  Homebrew metadata.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-05-06

### Release Packaging
- fix: ship a signed and notarized macOS release archive and refresh the
  Homebrew checksum for the patch release.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-06

### Private API Bridge
- feat: port the BlueBubbles-inspired private-API bridge surface for rich sends,
  message mutation, chat management, account/nickname introspection, and live
  bridge events; add local DB search and v2 concurrent bridge IPC (#100, thanks
  @omarshahine).
- fix: route default bridge calls over v2 IPC when available and reject
  unsupported `chat-create --service SMS` requests instead of reporting a
  service that was not applied.
- fix: decode typedstream attributed bodies with `0x81`/`0x82` length prefixes
  so long fallback message text is preserved in history and watch output (#99,
  thanks @SagarSDagdu).

### Docs And CI
- docs: publish the per-feature docs site at `imsg.sh` and add
  syntax-highlighted code examples.
- ci: update GitHub Actions for the Node 24 runtime and quote workflow
  architecture lookup.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-05

### More Reliable Live Streams And History
- fix: keep `imsg watch` streams alive with a lightweight polling fallback when macOS misses filesystem events (#78).
- fix: dedupe URL preview balloon messages in `watch` without dropping similar messages from other chats or older database schemas (#64, thanks @lesaai).
- fix: decode UTF-16LE BOM attributed bodies so plain-text history output recovers messages whose `text` column is empty (#91, thanks @clawbunny).
- fix: speed up JSON history output by batching attachment and reaction metadata lookups (#81, thanks @kacy).
- fix: speed up chat listing by using `chat_message_join.message_date` when Messages provides it (#76, thanks @tmad4000).
- docs: clarify stale Full Disk Access grants, Terminal.app permissions, and watch fallback polling requirements (#28, #32, #33, #46, #83, thanks @wangran870414).

### Better Chat, Group, And Account Diagnostics
- feat: add `imsg group --chat-id <id>` to inspect a chat's identifier, GUID, service, participants, account metadata, and group/direct status (#88, thanks @mryanb).
- feat: resolve Contacts names in `chats`, `history`, `watch`, and direct sends while preserving raw handles for automation (#75, #77, thanks @regaw-leinad and @jsindy).
- feat: expose read-only account routing hints (`account_id`, `account_login`, `last_addressed_handle`) for multi-number diagnostics (#18).
- fix: include group metadata in CLI JSON history/watch output, not just RPC payloads (#57, thanks @clawbunny).

### Sending, RPC, And Automation Fixes
- fix: return best-effort sent message `id` and `guid` from RPC `send` responses when the row can be observed after Messages accepts the send (#85).
- fix: expose RPC watch debounce and default it to 500ms to reduce outbound echo races (#72, #80).
- fix: gate RPC watch reaction metadata on `include_reactions`, not `attachments` (#82).
- fix: confirm standard tapback reaction selection in Messages automation before reporting success (#53, thanks @PeterRosdahl).
- fix: reject unsupported custom emoji reaction sends instead of taking a no-op AppleScript path (#55).
- fix: detect Tahoe group-send ghost rows and fail instead of reporting false success (#90, thanks @loop).
- docs: document standard tapback sending and watch reaction events (#66, thanks @safaaleigh).

### Attachments, Completions, And Install Polish
- feat: optionally report model-compatible converted receive-side attachment files for CAF audio and GIF images (#73, thanks @mfzeidan).
- feat: add shell completions and an LLM-oriented command reference generator (`imsg completions bash|zsh|fish|llm`) (#21, thanks @bdmorin).
- fix: publish universal macOS release binaries for Homebrew installs (#68, #79).
- docs: document the Homebrew install path in the README (#61, thanks @joshuayoes).
- docs: clarify that `send --file` supports regular file and audio attachments through Messages.app (#35, thanks @rock19).
- docs: add a local release helper for dispatching Homebrew tap updates (#97, thanks @dinakars777).

### Advanced IMCore / Tahoe Notes
- feat: add advanced IMCore controls for `status`, `launch`, `read`, and typing diagnostics.
- fix: normalize IMCore typing chat lookup across `iMessage`, `SMS`, and `any` prefixes (#51, #54, #56, #58).
- fix: report macOS 26/Tahoe IMCore typing entitlement failures as advanced-feature setup errors instead of misleading chat lookup failures (#60).
- docs: document macOS 26 advanced IMCore injection, library-validation, and private-entitlement limits (#60).

### Internal Safety
- refactor: centralize Messages schema detection, row decoding, query assembly, typed row IDs, and attachment/reaction query paths behind smaller `MessageStore` extensions.
- test: expand release packaging, CLI metadata, schema-compatibility, JSON newline, stdout capture, and live-read coverage.
